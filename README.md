# churn-prediction-system
End to end machine learning system for predicting user churn from behavioral data

## Problem

User churn is costly and often invisible until it is too late. This project builds an end to end machine learning system to predict churn risk from user behavior data.

## Goal

Predict whether a user is likely to churn in the near future and expose predictions through an API.

## Scope

This project focuses on data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and deployment readiness.
